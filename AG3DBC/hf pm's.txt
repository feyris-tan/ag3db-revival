Artificial Girl 3 Database Client BETA
----------
hi!

my Artificial Girl 3 Database Client is ready for BETA testing! i'm only sending out a select number of copies and i've selected you guys to test it out and tell me what you think!

before i can send you the program i'll need some information:

[list=1]
[*]a password for your login (your username will be your HongFire username)
[*]your email address (for database updates and character upload notifications)[/list]
please send this information via a HongFire PM! if you do not reply i'll assume you're not interested in BETA testing the program.

thanks!

thank you for your interest in my Artificial Girl 3 Database Client! :)

here's the link to the program: [url]http://stuff.sosavalanche.net/AG3DBC_BETA.exe[/url]
(you must agree to the terms of use before installing)

here is your login information:
Username: [b]username[/b]
Password: [b]pwd[/b]

please report any problems and errors you may encounter!

also i'd like some feed back from you so i've written some questions i'd like you to look at:

[list=1]
[*]Would you like to see lots of database statistics like top rated characters and users, etc.
[*]Would you use a character commenting system?
[*]Considering that i will be implementing a character tagging system where you can add custom tags to your characters and search tags of other characters in the datase, do you think a searching system based on character's properties like hair, body, face, etc is truly neccessary?
[*]Do you think adding custom previews is neccessary?
[*]If you made changes to one of your already existing characters, would you rather upload it as a new character or update it in the database?
[*]Would you care if the program's window size increased?
[*]Do you have any other improvements and/or suggestions?
[/list]
please feel free to answer as many or as little questions as you like!

thanks again! :)
